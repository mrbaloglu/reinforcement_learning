# Learn Gitlab

We prepared tutorials to help you set up GitLab in a way to support your complete software development life cycle. Each tutorial is contained in an issue, and features a task to complete.

View the tutorials by clicking on [Issues > Boards](../../boards) in the left sidebar. Complete each tutorial in turn by working through the Open list. When you've completed a tutorial, drag its issue card to the Closed list and move on to the next.
